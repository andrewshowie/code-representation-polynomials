# Code Representation with Dependency Tree Polynomials

This repository implements a novel approach to code representation, analysis, and generation using dependency tree polynomials and optimal transport theory. The project explores mathematical frameworks for encoding syntactic and semantic properties of code, enabling advanced comparison, retrieval, and evaluation of programming structures.

## Motivation

Large language models excel at code generation but face fundamental challenges in navigating the complex semantic and structural spaces of programming languages. This project addresses these challenges through a mathematical lens that treats code representation as a transport optimization problem across knowledge networks, where the fundamental mechanism is energy minimization constrained by structural topology.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Dependency Tree Polynomials

We introduce a polynomial representation system for encoding the syntactic relationships in code:
- Each dependency relationship is represented as a variable in a polynomial
- Coefficients indicate frequency or importance of each relationship
- The entire polynomial forms a unique "signature" of code structure

### 2. Optimal Transport for Code Comparison

We apply optimal transport theory to measure the distance between code structures:
- Treating polynomial coefficients as distributions
- Calculating the minimal "energy" required to transform one structure into another
- Providing a principled mathematical foundation for structural similarity

### 3. Multilingual Code Support

Our approach extends across different programming languages:
- Unified representation of code structures across languages
- Cross-language structural comparison
- Language-agnostic analysis of implementation patterns

### 4. Hybrid Structural-Semantic Representations

We combine structural polynomials with neural code embeddings:
- Integration with pre-trained code models like CodeBERT
- Balanced representation of both structure and meaning
- Enhanced similarity metrics and code retrieval

### 5. Evaluation Framework for Code Generation

We develop novel metrics for assessing code generation quality:
- Structure-aware evaluation beyond simple text matching
- Polynomial-based difference quantification
- Detailed structural feedback for generated code

### 6. Structural Guidance for LLMs

We implement methods to guide LLM code generation:
- Template-based structural prompting
- Feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement
- Automated template selection based on task requirements

## Basic Usage

### Code Structure Analysis

```python
from src.core.dependency_tree import extract_dependencies, compute_polynomial_coefficients

# Analyze code structure
code = """
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""

# Extract dependencies
dependencies, dep_types, graph = extract_dependencies(code)

# Compute polynomial representation
coefficients, var_mapping = compute_polynomial_coefficients(dependencies, dep_types)

# Print polynomial representation
print("Polynomial representation:")
print(polynomial_to_string(coefficients, var_mapping))
```

### Comparing Code Structures

```python
from src.core.optimal_transport import compute_ot_distance

# Compare two code snippets
code1 = """
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""

code2 = """
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
"""

# Extract dependencies and compute coefficients for both snippets
deps1, types1, _ = extract_dependencies(code1)
deps2, types2, _ = extract_dependencies(code2)

all_types = types1.union(types2)
coef1, mapping1 = compute_polynomial_coefficients(deps1, all_types)
coef2, mapping2 = compute_polynomial_coefficients(deps2, all_types)

# Compute optimal transport distance
distance = compute_ot_distance(coef1, coef2)
print(f"Structural distance: {distance:.4f}")
```
